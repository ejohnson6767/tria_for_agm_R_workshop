Each row represents a tree. 
At breast height (1.3m), take two disk samples for each of the north and south sides of the tree, resulting in 4 disks per tree.
Disks are aquired with a 4 inch diameter hole saw bit. 
Surveyors are instructed to only take samples from successfully attacked trees. A rule of thumb is that a successfully attacked tree has more than 40 entrance holes across the entire trunk.
Samples are taken primarily in May and June, just before emergence.
Disks are cooled, then later brought to up to room temperature. Individuals are considered to be alive if they move when poked.
